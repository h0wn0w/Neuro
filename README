= ABOUT PROJECT NEURO =
=======================
Project Neuro is a web-based application, built on the LAMP stack, that will allow users to use a simple file-sharing tool with the ability to add extensions, modules and skins. The name was inspired by the brain's neurones which are used to store information through synaptic transmissions. A one-to-one communication between two Neuro accounts is, in fact, called a synaptic transmission. A network of Neuro accounts is called a NeuroNet, in tribute to the neural network of the brain.
